# -ARM-Cortex-M0-Based-SoC-Desig
Design and develop an ARM Cortex M0 based SoC by interfacing the  peripherals Timer, Memory (255x32 Single port RAM) and GPIO/LED.
ðŸ”§ ARM Cortex-M0 Based SoC Design â€“ A Brief Overview
This project involves the design and development of a custom System-on-Chip (SoC) based on the ARM Cortex-M0 processor core, aimed at demonstrating efficient integration of key peripherals. The SoC features:

Timer Module for precise time-based operations and delay generation

255Ã—32 Single-Port RAM acting as on-chip memory for data and instruction storage

GPIO Interface with LEDs for basic input/output control and real-time status display

The design is implemented using Verilog HDL, simulating interaction and interrupt-driven behavior through an integrated testbench. The project serves as a foundational step toward understanding embedded system design, hardware-software co-design, and peripheral interfacing in modern microcontroller architectures
